/**
 * Defines a common interface for managing application project stages, abstracting the
 * concept from specific implementations like JSF's or DeltaSpike's ProjectStage.
 * Project stages are used to configure application behavior based on the deployment
 * environment.
 *
 * <p>Features:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Supports three standard stages: Development, Test, and Production</li>
 *   <li>Provides clear stage identification methods</li>
 *   <li>Treats unknown stages as Production for safety</li>
 *   <li>Implements {@link Serializable} for state management</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Usage Example:
 * <pre>
 * // Check current stage and adjust behavior
 * if (projectStage.isDevelopment()) {
 *     // Enable detailed logging
 *     logger.setLevel(Level.DEBUG);
 *     // Show development tools
 *     devTools.setVisible(true);
 * }
 *
 * // Configure caching based on stage
 * if (projectStage.isProduction()) {
 *     // Enable aggressive caching
 *     cache.setTimeToLive(Duration.ofHours(24));
 * } else {
 *     // Disable caching for development/test
 *     cache.disable();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Implementation Notes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Implementations should ensure exactly one stage is active at a time</li>
 *   <li>The production stage should be the default for undefined cases</li>
 *   <li>Stage transitions should not be allowed during runtime</li>
 * </ul>
