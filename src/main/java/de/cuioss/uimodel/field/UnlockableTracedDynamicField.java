/**
 * Extends {@link TracedDynamicField} to provide a field that is read-only by default
 * but can be temporarily unlocked for editing. This pattern is useful for implementing
 * protected or sensitive fields that require explicit user action before modification.
 *
 * <p>Key features:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Default read-only state for data protection</li>
 *   <li>Explicit unlocking mechanism for editing</li>
 *   <li>State tracking for edit mode</li>
 *   <li>Ability to reset to read-only state</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Common use cases:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Protected configuration settings</li>
 *   <li>Sensitive user data fields</li>
 *   <li>Fields requiring confirmation before editing</li>
 *   <li>Two-step modification processes</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of value managed by this field. Must be {@link Serializable}
 *            to support persistence and distribution.
