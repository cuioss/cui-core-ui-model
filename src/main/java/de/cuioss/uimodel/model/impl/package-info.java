/**
 * Provides concrete implementations of the UI model interfaces, offering ready-to-use
 * components for common UI model patterns and requirements.
 *
 * <p>Key Components:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link de.cuioss.uimodel.model.impl.BaseRangeCounter} - Base implementation
 *       of the RangeCounter interface, providing pagination and range management</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Design Principles:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Clean and efficient implementations</li>
 *   <li>Thread-safe where appropriate</li>
 *   <li>Immutable where possible</li>
 *   <li>Comprehensive error handling</li>
 *   <li>Proper null-value handling</li>
